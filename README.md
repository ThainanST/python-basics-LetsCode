# python-basics-LetsCode

This repo was created with the python basics solutions exercises for Santander Coders - LetsCode

With this code in MATLAB I show how the dynamic modeling of the EMT-TS co-simulation (Electromagnetic Transients - Transient Stability) was developed  in my PhD Thesis ðŸ˜¨. You can find more information some articles when I publish then ðŸ˜‚: 

A simplified circuit of an AC transmission system was used. Through data from a real system, it is possible to generate an s-plane with the location of the poles for variation of several parameters, for example the Rth, Xth, and so on ðŸ“‰.
